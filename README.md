Features
--------

* Generates an array of items to be pushed into a list of any kind
* Has enter mapped to the submit item
* Remove items easily

Usage
-----

This plugin stores 2 things, a key(the index of the item) and the value(value of the input).
You can use has_item and a count of items.

``` html
{{ if my_field_slug:has_item }}
You have {{ my_field_slug:count }} item(s) in your cart:
<ul>
{{ my_field_slug:items }}
  <li class="item{{ key }}">{{ value }}</li>
{{ /my_field_slug:items }}
</ul>
{{ endif }}
```

If there was 3 items, this would output:

``` html
You have 3 item(s) in your cart:
<ul>
  <li class="item0">Item String Value</li>
  <li class="item1">Item String Value</li>
  <li class="item2">Item String Value</li>
</ul>
```

To Do
-----

* Switch serialization to JSON decode/encode (will be easier to make more of the todo I think)
* Add sorting/ordering
* Allow child list items
* List to string instead of just array
* Allow styling/classes/odd and even
* Allow links (url, target, title etc.)
* Allow setting of key (index or string etc.)
